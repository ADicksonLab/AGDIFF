This repository contains the official implementation of the work "AGDIFF: Attention-Enhanced Diffusion for Molecular Geometry Prediction".

AGDIFF introduces a novel approach that enhances diffusion models with attention mechanisms and an improved SchNet architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance in predicting molecular geometries.

### Unique Features of AGDIFF

- **Attention Mechanisms**: Enhances the global and local encoders with attention mechanisms for better feature extraction and integration.
- **Improved SchNet Architecture**: Incorporates learnable activation functions, adaptive scaling modules, and dual pathway processing to increase model expressiveness.
- **Batch Normalization**: Stabilizes training and improves convergence for the local encoder.
- **Feature Expansion**: Extends the MLP Edge Encoder with feature expansion and processing, combining processed features and bond embeddings for more adaptable edge representations.

## Environment Setup ##


### Install via Conda

```bash
conda env create -f agdiff.yml
conda activate agdiff
```



## Dataset ##

### Official Dataset
The official raw GEOM dataset is available [[here]](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/JNGTDF).

## Training ##

AGDIFF's training details and hyper-parameters are provided in the config files (`./configs/*.yml`). Feel free to tune these parameters as needed.

To train the model, use the following commands:

```bash
python train.py qm9_default.yml
python train.py drugs_default.yml
``` 
Model checkpoints, configuration YAML files, and training logs will be saved in a directory specified by `--logdir` in `train.py`.

## Generation ##

To generate conformations for entire or part of test sets, use:

```bash 
python test.py ${log}/${model}/checkpoints/${iter}.pt ./configs/qm9_default.yml \
    --start_idx 0 --end_idx 200
```
Here `start_idx` and `end_idx` indicate the range of the test set that we want to use. To reproduce the paper's results, you should use 0 and 200 for start_idx and end_idx, respectively. All hyper-parameters related to sampling can be set in `test.py` files. Specifically, for testing the qm9 model, you could add the additional arg `--w_global 0.3`, which empirically shows slightly better results.


## Evaluation ##

After generating conformations, evaluate the results of benchmark tasks using the following commands.

### Task 1. Conformation Generation

Calculate `COV` and `MAT` scores on the GEOM datasets with:

```bash
python eval_covmat.py ${log}/${model}/${sample}/sample_all.pkl
```
